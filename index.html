      So you're just sitting there, minding your own business, drinking
      <strong>Busch Light</strong> in between shots of
      <strong>Fireball</strong>, when all of the sudden you see bright lights
      coming through the window. It's only <em>11 a.m.</em>, so the bright
      lights are a bit of a concern. Chances are, aliens from Uranus are coming
      to probe you and then abduct you along with any cattle that happen to be
      nearby.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this post, we'll talk about ways to avoid being probed by aliens. We
      will learn how to accomplish this with <strong>C</strong>ommon
      <strong>H</strong>ousehold <strong>T</strong>acos, why it's important to
      have salsa in the fridge at all times, and why you should never eat all
      ten tacos in the party pack.
    </p>

    <p>
      You mostly want to be paying attention to three body parts when being
      abducted by aliens from Uranus:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Your anus</li>
      <li>Your mouth</li>
      <li>Your taco hand</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Do the tacos need to be supreme? Yes!</h3>

    <p>
      The short answer is "Yes!" Aliens love tacos supreme. In fact, they know
      that the noun is plural, not the following adjective. This is similar to
      sergeants major. But you knew that because you went to DINFOS and studied
      the AP Style Guide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aliens are fantastic at identifying spelling and grammar errors, such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Who, who's, whose</li>
      <li>It's and its</li>
      <li>They're, their, there</li>
      <li>Who or whom</li>
      <li>Whether or weather</li>
      <li>Dessert or desert</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      But you can never be sure if an alien from Uranus is a salsa bro or a
      supreme bro. Always try to get on a first name basis with the alien who's
      trying to abduct you. If they call you by your name, they may learn to
      look at you as more than an object to be probed, and more like a friend to
      do shots of
