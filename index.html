          So you're just sitting there, minding your own business, drinking
          <strong>Busch Light</strong> in between shots of
          <strong>Fireball</strong>, when all of the sudden you see bright
          lights coming through the window. It's only <em>11 a.m.</em>, so the
          bright lights are a bit of a concern. Chances are, aliens from Uranus
          are coming to probe you and then abduct you along with any cattle that
          happen to be nearby.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this post, we'll talk about ways to avoid being probed by aliens.
          We will learn how to accomplish this with <strong>C</strong>ommon
          <strong>H</strong>ousehold <strong>T</strong>acos, why it's important
          to have salsa in the fridge at all times, and why you should never eat
          all ten tacos in the party pack.
        </p>

        <p>
          You mostly want to be paying attention to three body parts when being
          abducted by aliens from Uranus:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li class="first-li">Your anus</li>
          <li>Your mouth</li>
          <li>Your taco hand</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="colors">
          <div class="color"><p>A</p></div>
          <div class="color"><p>L</p></div>
          <div class="color"><p>I</p></div>
          <div class="color"><p>E</p></div>
          <div class="color"><p>N</p></div>
          <div class="color"><p>S</p></div>
        </div>
        <h3>Do the tacos need to be supreme? Yes!</h3>

        <p>
          The short answer is "Yes!" Aliens love tacos supreme. In fact, they
          know that the noun is plural, not the following adjective. This is
          similar to sergeants major. But you knew that because you went to
          DINFOS and studied the AP Style Guide.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aliens are fantastic at identifying spelling and grammar errors, such
          as:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="first-li">Who, who's, whose</li>
          <li>It's and its</li>
          <li>They're, their, there</li>
          <li>Who or whom</li>
          <li>Whether or weather</li>
          <li>Dessert or desert</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          But you can never be sure if an alien from Uranus is a salsa bro or a
          supreme bro. Always try to get on a first name basis with the alien
          who's trying to abduct you. If they call you by your name, they may
          learn to look at you as more than an object to be probed, and more
          like a friend to do shots of
